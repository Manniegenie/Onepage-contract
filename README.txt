OnePageLiquidity is a lightweight decentralized liquidity pool contract built for creator-owned trading pages. It allows creators to deploy simple token pairs, provide liquidity, collect swap fees, and earn a share of platform fees on swaps between any two ERC20 tokens.

âœ¨ Features
Add and remove token pairs (creator-only)

Deposit and withdraw liquidity per pair (creator-only)

Perform token swaps with configurable fees

Automatic fee split between creator and platform

Built-in reentrancy protection

Minimal dependencies using OpenZeppeli

I also added two mocktokens to mirror real tokens you can use to test the contract. Stay tuned, I intend to adfd liquidity pool for lending.
